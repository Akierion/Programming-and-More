\n1: Each 'player' draws 2 cards
2: Players get three options, these are to either stick, twist or fold
\t-Sticking takes your score from the value of the cards in your hand
\t-Twisting adds another card to the your hand
\t-Folding throws your hand away and results in a score of 0
3: Players go bust when their cards/score exceed 21
